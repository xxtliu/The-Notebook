# The-Notebook

The Notebook serves as a shared diary for couples who are suffering from being apart. As a lot of couples may have to live in different cities or even time zones, they may resort to SNS platforms for maintaining communication. However, as the immediate interaction is usually failed in that cases, and SNS tools may be filled with various content, it is powerless for deeper communication. We are trying to make a website that preserves the shared memory and alleviates the time and distance constraints between loved ones by allowing them to post their daily updates/diary.
